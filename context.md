# Project Context

## Summary
- Rebranded the landing page around the OSSGenesis GitHub organization and updated navigation/hero CTAs.
- Highlighted all public repositories with detailed feature breakdowns in both the featured projects and repositories sections.
- Inlined full content from the Agile methodology and Change Management `.docx` documents in the blog section (download links preserved).
- Refreshed activity, about, and footer sections to point to the ossgenesis properties.
- Credited Bibin Skaria as site administrator/publisher, added donation pathways, polished visuals with extra CSS, and moved the full blog content into a dedicated `blog.html` page linked from the nav.
- Published the "How to Use Jenkins Effectively with ECS/EKS Cluster" article (Apr 2025) with full `.docx` content and architecture diagram rendering in `blog.html`.

## Pending Items
- `.docx` source documents remain untracked; convert to Markdown/HTML in-repo if binary files become inconvenient.
- Consider automating repository metadata (language, updated date) from the GitHub API during build so it stays current.
