# Project Context

## Summary
- Extended `index.html` navigation with anchors for repositories and blog sections.
- Added a GitHub organization repositories section sourced from the ossgenesis public repos list.
- Added a blog section linking to two internal `.docx` process documents with publication timestamps.

## Pending Items
- `.docx` source documents remain untracked for now; convert to Markdown if you prefer in-repo documentation without binary files.
- Consider automating repository data retrieval during build rather than manual updates.
